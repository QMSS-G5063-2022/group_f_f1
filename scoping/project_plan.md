### Goals
##### 2: Agree on Goals, Assign exploratory viz
  - The first purpose of this meeting is to agree on the project plan (this doc), dates, goals, and to assign owners to relevant goals/tasks.
  - The second purpose of this meeting is to take the ideas generated when writing the (topic proposal)[https://github.com/QMSS-G5063-2022/group_f_f1/blob/main/scoping/topic_proposal.pdf], subdivide them into distinct areas of research/exploration and assign them out to group members. 
    - It is worth noting that group members who are taking a heavier lift of project managing or compiling the website could take a lighter load of creating viz or doing exploratory work.

Assigned out exploratory viz:
- Christa: Circuit-specific stats
- Lauren: Driver Performance (Qualifying Positions, Podiums, Pit Stops)
- Nikki: Constructor Ranking, Driver Performance (Clinches, etc)
- Donald: Car Performance, Financial Analysis

##### 3 - 5: Report out on exploratory viz, decide on main theme, assign final viz
  - Group members should walk through some exploratory viz that each person created
  - Group members should decide on a main theme. ie:
    - What question are we trying to answer?
    - Should we focus on just drivers/just makers/just hardware/just tracks?
  - Group members should walk away knowing which visualizations they are responsible for building
##### 6: Send out final viz to group members for edits/thoughts
  - Group members should send out draft viz ahead of meeting to give time for other group members to look at/react to
##### 7-8: Provide edits, assign out text blurbs
  - Group members should walk through final viz and pitch which viz should make it into the website
  - Once final viz is agreed upon, group members will get assigned text blurbs that will need to accompany the visualizations
##### 9: Send final viz and text around for group feedback
  - Group members should send the visualizations and blurbs that they are responsible for to the group for feedback and edits
##### 10: Compile viz into website
  - TBD person compiles all of the final viz into a website (this doesn't have to be perfect right now)
##### 11: Comments from group on website
  - Group members should write comments (in github or whatever is easiest) and give feedback/edits on our draft website
##### 12-13: Resolve comments, draft website is ready for submission
  - Group member responsible for compiling the website should go through group members' comments and incorporate where relevant
##### 14: Final Project comments due
  - Our group will need to provide comments on other groups' projects. One person should be in charge of compiling thoughts from our group and submitting (depending on the format of submission)
##### 15: Final Project website due
