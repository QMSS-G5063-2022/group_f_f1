## Project Summary
Formula 1 is the highest class of single-driver racing. There are 10 teams and 20 drivers (two drivers per team) that compete during a Formula 1 season, although there are occasionally driver substitutes if a driver is unavailable. In 2021, the Formula 1 season consisted of 22 races in 20 different countries. While the current scope of the project is still in discussion, we will be using data that is sourced from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=circuits.csv) and that data will be cleaned, munged, and visualized by this team. 


## Extra Materials
The Drive to Survive Netflix Docu-series ([Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtJPe1ksS6E)) is extremely fun and dramatic and will give you some insight into this sport.
